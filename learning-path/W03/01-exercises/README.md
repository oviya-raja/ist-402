# Week 3 Exercises - RAG with Model Evaluation

## 📚 Purpose
Step-by-step learning materials to master advanced RAG systems with model evaluation.

## 🎯 Exercise

**01-rag-with-model-evaluation/** - Build a complete RAG system with:
- Business-specific system prompts
- Q&A database generation using Mistral-7B
- Advanced FAISS vector database implementation
- Testing with answerable and unanswerable questions
- Model comparison and ranking (4+ QA models)
- Performance evaluation (accuracy, confidence, speed)

## 📖 What You'll Learn

- How to create business-specific Q&A databases
- How to implement advanced FAISS indexing
- How to test RAG systems with different question types
- How to compare and rank multiple QA models
- How to evaluate model performance metrics
- How to handle confidence scoring and uncertainty

## 📖 How to Use

1. Complete **Week 1** and **Week 2** exercises first
2. Start with `01-rag-with-model-evaluation/` exercise
3. Follow the notebook step-by-step
4. Use `../03-learnings/` for concept review
5. When ready, check `../02-assignments/` for the main assignment

## 🔗 Prerequisites
