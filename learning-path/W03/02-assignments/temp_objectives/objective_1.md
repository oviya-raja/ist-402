OBJECTIVE 1: DESIGN SYSTEM PROMPTS FOR LLM-BASED CUSTOMER SERVICE
============================================================================

LEARNING OBJECTIVES DEMONSTRATED:
1. System Prompt Engineering - Crafting prompts that shape LLM behavior
2. Modular Design - SOLID, KISS, DRY principles in practice

THEORETICAL BACKGROUND:
System prompts serve as the "constitution" for LLM behavior, establishing:
- Role Identity: Who the model should act as
- Knowledge Boundaries: What the model knows and doesn't know
- Behavioral Constraints: Response style, escalation rules
- Domain Context: Business-specific information
