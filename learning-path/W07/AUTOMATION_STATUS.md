## ✅ WHAT I'VE DONE

1. ✅ Opened OpenAI Platform
2. ✅ Navigated to login page
3. ✅ Entered email: omr5104@psu.edu
4. ✅ Stored credentials in `credentials.txt`
5. ⏳ **Waiting for login completion**

---

## ⚠️ CURRENT ISSUE

**The login process requires manual completion because:**

1. **CAPTCHA** - May require human verification
2. **Email Verification** - May need to check email for verification code
3. **2FA** - May require two-factor authentication
4. **Password Field** - May need manual password entry if page doesn't auto-advance

**These steps cannot be fully automated.**

## 🎯 WHAT TO DO NOW

### Option 1: Complete Login Manually (Recommended)

1. **The browser is open** on the login page
2. **Email is already entered:** omr5104@psu.edu
3. **You need to:**
   - Enter password: `Ovi42647715S$`
   - Complete any CAPTCHA if shown
   - Check email for verification code if needed
   - Complete 2FA if enabled
4. **Once logged in, tell me:** "I'm logged in" or "continue"
5. **I'll then automate the rest:** Creating agent, uploading files, etc.

### Option 2: I Continue After You Log In

**Once you're logged in:**
- Tell me "I'm logged in" or "continue"
- I'll automatically:
  - Navigate to Assistants
  - Create the agent
  - Paste system prompt
  - Configure model and tools
  - Upload knowledge base files
  - Test the agent
  - Take screenshots

## 💡 RECOMMENDATION

**Best approach:**
1. Complete login manually in the browser (2-3 minutes)
2. Tell me "I'm logged in"
3. I'll automate everything else (5-10 minutes)

**This is the fastest way!**
