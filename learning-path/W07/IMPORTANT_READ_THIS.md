# ⚠️ IMPORTANT: About Building the Agent

## Why I Cannot Build the Agent For You

**I cannot access the OpenAI Platform or build the agent for you because:**

1. **I don't have access to your OpenAI account** - You need to log in with your credentials
2. **I cannot use web browsers** - The OpenAI Platform requires browser access
3. **I cannot click buttons or interact with web interfaces** - Building requires manual interaction
4. **Security reasons** - Your account credentials are private

**This is normal and expected** - You need to build the agent yourself using the instructions I've prepared.
