# Screenshots Guide: Built-in Tools Only

## 📸 Why Screenshots Are Required (20 pts)

Screenshots demonstrate that you've actually built and configured the agent in Agent Builder UI. They provide visual proof of your implementation.

## 🎯 Required Screenshots (Per Rubric)

The rubric requires screenshots showing:

1. ✅ **Agent configuration** - Basic settings, model selection
2. ✅ **Tools/functions** - Which built-in tools are enabled
3. ✅ **Prompt instructions** - Your system prompt/instructions
4. ✅ **Memory settings** - If applicable
5. ✅ **Testing/execution** - Agent actually working
6. ✅ **Evidence of deployment** - Agent is accessible and working (cloud-based)

## 📋 Specific Screenshots to Take

### 1. Agent Configuration Page
**What to capture:**
- Agent name
- Model selection (gpt-4o, gpt-4-turbo, etc.)
- Description

### 2. Tools Setup (Built-in Tools Only)
**What to capture:**
- File Search enabled
- Code Interpreter enabled (if used)
- Web Search enabled (if used)
- No custom functions (since we're using built-in tools only)

**How to capture:**
- Go to Agent Builder → Your Assistant → Tools
- Take screenshot showing enabled built-in tools

### 3. Prompt Instructions/System Prompt
**What to capture:**
- Your configured instructions
- System prompt text
- Any specific guidelines

### 6. Evidence of Deployment
**What to capture:**
- Agent is accessible
- Agent is working
- URL showing platform.openai.com (cloud deployment)

**How to capture:**

## ❓ About "Local/Cloud" Requirement

### For Built-in Tools Approach:

**Agent Builder is cloud-based:**
- ✅ Accessed at https://platform.openai.com/agent-builder
- ✅ Your agent is automatically deployed in the cloud when you create it
- ✅ Screenshots showing agent working = evidence of cloud deployment
- ✅ **No local setup needed** - Everything is cloud-based

**Built-in Tools:**
- ✅ File Search - Cloud-based (OpenAI manages)
- ✅ Code Interpreter - Cloud-based (OpenAI manages)
- ✅ Web Search - Cloud-based (OpenAI manages)
- ✅ Computer Use - Cloud-based (OpenAI manages)

**Result:**
- ✅ **Everything is cloud-based** - No local deployment needed
- ✅ Screenshots of Agent Builder UI = evidence of cloud deployment
- ✅ No additional "deployment" steps needed
