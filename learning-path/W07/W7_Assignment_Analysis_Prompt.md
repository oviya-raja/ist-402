## 🚀 RECOMMENDED WORKFLOW CHOICE FOR SOLO COMPLETION

**Best Option: "Automating Student Query Responses Using a Knowledge Base"**

Why this is ideal for solo work:
1. **Straightforward to implement** - OpenAI's built-in knowledge base features
2. **Easy to demonstrate** - Clear input/output for testing
3. **Minimal external dependencies** - Reduces API complexity
4. **Strong documentation potential** - Educational context is well-defined
5. **Scalable for report** - Lots to write about
