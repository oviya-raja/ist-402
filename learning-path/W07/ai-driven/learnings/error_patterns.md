#### Quality Errors
*Common quality issues*

**Pattern 1: Quantitative Data Deficiency**
- **Description:** Missing statistics, metrics, or quantitative evidence in documentation
- **Frequency:** High (100% of assessments so far)
- **Context:** Problem statements, user definitions, impact statements
- **Impact:** Reduces credibility, makes claims less convincing
- **How to Avoid:** Always look for quantitative data to support claims. Include metrics, percentages, or statistics when available. If unavailable, note it explicitly.

**Pattern 2: Visual Documentation Gaps**
- **Description:** Missing diagrams, maps, or visual aids for complex concepts
- **Frequency:** Medium (50% of assessments)
- **Context:** User definitions, workflow documentation, technical specs
- **Impact:** Less engaging, harder to understand complex concepts
- **How to Avoid:** Consider visual aids (diagrams, flowcharts, maps) when text alone is insufficient. Include charts/graphs for quantitative data.

**Pattern 3: Context/Specificity Gaps**
- **Description:** Missing specific context, details, or special considerations
- **Frequency:** Medium (50% of assessments)
- **Context:** Problem statements, user definitions, technical documentation
- **Impact:** Less precise, potential misunderstandings, missing important considerations
- **How to Avoid:** Include specific context (not just general). Address edge cases, accessibility, scope limitations explicitly.

**Pattern 4: Comparative Analysis Missing**
- **Description:** Missing comparisons to similar solutions or industry benchmarks
- **Frequency:** Medium (50% of assessments)
- **Context:** Problem statements, solution design, impact statements
- **Impact:** Missing context for positioning, no validation against existing solutions
- **How to Avoid:** Reference similar solutions, include industry benchmarks, compare to existing approaches when relevant.
