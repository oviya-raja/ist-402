# W07 Assignment: OpenAI Agent Builder

## 🎯 Two Approaches Available

### 1. **Out-of-Box Tools (Recommended - Start Here)** ⭐
**Location:** [`out-of-box/`](out-of-box/)  
**Focus:** Built-in tools only (File Search, Code Interpreter, Web Search)  
**Complexity:** Low  
**Time:** 30 minutes - 2 hours  
**No coding required!**

👉 **Start here:** [`out-of-box/README.md`](out-of-box/README.md)

### 2. **Advanced (Function Calling)** 
**Location:** This directory  
**Focus:** Custom functions, API integration, local deployment  
**Complexity:** Medium-High  
**Time:** 2-4 hours  
**Requires coding**

## 📋 Assignment Overview

**Objective:** Automate workflows using OpenAI Agents to improve efficiency and reduce manual effort.

**Instructions:** Develop and deploy an AI agent using OpenAI Agent Builder tools that integrates with selected APIs and services.

## 🎯 Project Goals

1. Identify workflows suitable for automation
2. Build and deploy an OpenAI agent using Agent Builder
3. Integrate external data sources and APIs
4. Ensure collaborative development using version control
5. Document and present the setup and implementation

## 📦 Deliverables (100 Points Total)

1. **Functional OpenAI Agent** (20 pts) - Fully functional with proper prompt engineering, tools, error handling
2. **Documented Workflows** (20 pts) - Step-by-step documentation with diagrams, integration points, error handling
3. **GitHub Repository** (20 pts) - Well-organized with README, team details, proper structure (Optional)
4. **Screenshots** (20 pts) - Comprehensive screenshots of Agent Builder setup, configuration, tools, testing
5. **Final PDF Report** (20 pts) - Project overview, workflow justification, implementation details, team roles, challenges, results

## 💡 Example Workflows

- Automating student query responses using a knowledge base
- Scheduling meetings using calendar API
- Summarizing emails or documents

## 🚀 Quick Start

**👉 RECOMMENDED: Start with Out-of-Box Tools Approach**

1. Go to [`out-of-box/`](out-of-box/) directory
2. Read [`out-of-box/README.md`](out-of-box/README.md)
3. Follow [`out-of-box/QUICK_START.md`](out-of-box/QUICK_START.md)
4. Use built-in tools only - no coding required!

**For Advanced (Function Calling):**
- See [FUNCTION_CALLING_GUIDE.md](FUNCTION_CALLING_GUIDE.md)
- Requires local setup and coding

## ✅ Key Principles

- **Keep it simple** - Focus on basics and thorough understanding
- **Use Agent Builder UI** - Primary tool for agent creation
- **Leverage built-in tools** - File Search, Code Interpreter, Web Search
- **Document everything** - Screenshots, workflows, integration points

## 🎯 Success Checklist

- [ ] Uses appropriate built-in tools
- [ ] Knowledge base uploaded (if applicable)
- [ ] Tested with sample queries
- [ ] Screenshots captured (5+ screenshots)
- [ ] Workflow documented with diagram
- [ ] Integration points documented
- [ ] GitHub repository organized (optional)
- [ ] Final PDF report prepared

---

**Status:** ✅ Ready for implementation
