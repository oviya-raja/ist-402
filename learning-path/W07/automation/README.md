# W07 Assignment: OpenAI Agent Builder

## 📋 Assignment Overview

**Objective:** Automate workflows using OpenAI Agents to improve efficiency and reduce manual effort.

**Instructions:** Develop and deploy an AI agent using OpenAI Agent Builder tools that integrates with selected APIs and services.

## 🎯 Project Goals

1. Identify workflows suitable for automation
2. Build and deploy an OpenAI agent using Agent Builder
3. Integrate external data sources and APIs
4. Ensure collaborative development using version control
5. Document and present the setup and implementation

## 📦 Deliverables (100 Points Total)

1. **Functional OpenAI Agent** (20 pts) - Fully functional with proper prompt engineering, tools, error handling
2. **Documented Workflows** (20 pts) - Step-by-step documentation with diagrams, integration points, error handling
3. **GitHub Repository** (20 pts) - Well-organized with README, team details, proper structure (Optional)
4. **Screenshots** (20 pts) - Comprehensive screenshots of Agent Builder setup, configuration, tools, testing
5. **Final PDF Report** (20 pts) - Project overview, workflow justification, implementation details, team roles, challenges, results

## 💡 Example Workflows

- Automating student query responses using a knowledge base
- Scheduling meetings using calendar API
- Summarizing emails or documents

## 🚀 Implementation

**Location:** [`out-of-box/`](out-of-box/) - Complete implementation using built-in tools only

**Quick Start:**
1. Go to [`out-of-box/README.md`](out-of-box/README.md)
2. Follow implementation guide
3. Use `implement_assistant.py` to create assistant
4. Test and document

## 📚 Essential Documentation

All documentation is in [`out-of-box/`](out-of-box/):

- **[README.md](out-of-box/README.md)** - Project overview and quick start
- **[WORKFLOW_DOCUMENTATION.md](out-of-box/WORKFLOW_DOCUMENTATION.md)** - Complete workflow documentation (Required)
- **[PROBLEM_DEFINITION.md](out-of-box/PROBLEM_DEFINITION.md)** - Assignment requirements and alignment
- **[SCREENSHOTS_GUIDE.md](out-of-box/SCREENSHOTS_GUIDE.md)** - Screenshot capture instructions
- **[SUBMISSION_CHECKLIST.md](out-of-box/SUBMISSION_CHECKLIST.md)** - Final submission checklist

## ✅ Key Principles

- **Keep it simple** - Focus on basics and thorough understanding
- **Use Agent Builder UI** - Primary tool for agent creation
- **Leverage built-in tools** - File Search, Code Interpreter, Web Search
- **Document everything** - Screenshots, workflows, integration points

## 🎯 Current Status

- ✅ Assistant created and working
- ✅ Workflow documentation complete
- ✅ Implementation scripts ready
- ⚠️ Screenshots need to be captured
- ⚠️ Final PDF report needs to be compiled

**See:** [`out-of-box/SUBMISSION_CHECKLIST.md`](out-of-box/SUBMISSION_CHECKLIST.md) for complete status
