# Requirements Clarification - What's Actually Required?

## 🔍 Assignment Requirements Analysis

### What the Assignment Says:

**From assignment.md:**
- "Develop and deploy an AI agent using **OpenAI Agent Builder tools**"
- "Documented workflows" (20 pts deliverable)
- "Screenshots of OpenAI Agent Builder setup" (20 pts deliverable)

### Key Question: What is "Agent Builder"?

**Two Possible Interpretations:**

1. **Agent Builder = Assistants Interface** ✅ **What you have**
   - Your assistant is in: platform.openai.com/assistants
   - This is part of "Agent Builder tools"
   - Your assistant uses File Search (built-in tool)
   - ✅ **This meets the requirement!**

2. **Agent Builder = Visual Workflow Builder** ⚠️ **Optional/Advanced**
   - platform.openai.com/agent-builder (visual workflows)
   - Drag-and-drop nodes
   - More complex, not explicitly required
   - ⚠️ **This is NOT explicitly required**

---

## 🎯 Clarification: Workflow vs Visual Workflow

### What "Workflow" Means in Assignment:

**"Workflow" = Process/Steps** ✅ **You have this!**
- Step 1: Student asks question
- Step 2: Agent searches knowledge base
- Step 3: Agent generates answer
- Step 4: Response delivered

**This is documented in:** `WORKFLOW_DOCUMENTATION.md`

### What "Visual Workflow" Means (Agent Builder):

**"Visual Workflow" = Drag-and-drop nodes** ⚠️ **NOT Required**
- Visual workflow builder
- Nodes and connections
- More advanced feature

**This is optional** - Not explicitly required by assignment!
