# Assignment Management System - Cursor Rules Template
# This template works for ANY assignment - only assignment files change

## 🎯 PROJECT CONTEXT

**Assignment Files (CHANGE THESE FOR EACH ASSIGNMENT):**
- `Assignment_Analysis_Prompt.md` - Contains assignment requirements, rubrics, deliverables
- `Assignment_TODO_Tracker.md` - Contains all tasks, phases, and progress tracking

**IMPORTANT:** When starting a new assignment, only update the two files above. All other files remain the same.

---

## 📋 CORE WORKING METHODOLOGY

### 1. Initialization Protocol
When starting work on an assignment:
1. **Read Assignment Files:**
   - Read `Assignment_Analysis_Prompt.md` to understand requirements
   - Read `Assignment_TODO_Tracker.md` to see current progress
   - Read `state_tracker.json` to see current state (if exists)

2. **Load Learnings:**
   - Read `../_global_learnings/` for cross-assignment learnings
   - Read `ai-driven/learnings/` for assignment-specific learnings
   - Apply relevant learnings to current work

3. **Check State:**
   - If `ai-driven/state_tracker.json` exists, resume from last position
   - If not, start from Phase 1, Task 1

### 2. Task Execution Protocol

**Before Starting Each Task:**
1. Read current task from `Assignment_TODO_Tracker.md`
2. Check `ai-driven/state_tracker.json` for current position
3. Review relevant learnings from `ai-driven/learnings/` and `../_global_learnings/`
4. Check rubric alignment from `Assignment_Analysis_Prompt.md`

**During Task Execution:**
1. Complete the task according to requirements
2. Run self-assessment using `ai-driven/verification_checklists.md`
3. Generate task evaluation form
4. Log activity to episodic memory

**After Task Completion:**
1. **Self-Evaluation:**
   - Run `ai-driven/verification_checklists.md` task verification
   - Generate self-assessment score
   - Identify any gaps or improvements needed
   - Log to `ai-driven/self_feedback/self_assessments.md`

2. **Request Human Approval:**
   - Generate task approval form in `ai-driven/evaluations/task_evaluations.md`
   - Present work for review
   - **WAIT FOR HUMAN APPROVAL** before proceeding

3. **If Approved:**
   - Update `Assignment_TODO_Tracker.md` (mark checkbox)
   - Update `ai-driven/state_tracker.json` (increment progress)
   - Log to `ai-driven/episodic_memory/task_history.md`
   - Log to `ai-driven/episodic_memory/event_log.md`
   - Capture any learnings to `ai-driven/learnings/`
   - Proceed to next task

4. **If Rejected:**
   - Capture feedback to `ai-driven/learnings/feedback_learnings.md`
   - Update `ai-driven/self_feedback/improvement_suggestions.md`
   - Apply feedback and improve work
   - Resubmit for approval
   - Learn from mistake (update error patterns)

### 3. Phase Completion Protocol

**When All Tasks in Phase Complete:**
1. **Phase Self-Evaluation:**
   - Run phase verification checklist from `ai-driven/verification_checklists.md`
   - Assess phase objectives completion
   - Generate phase quality score
   - Log to `ai-driven/self_feedback/self_assessments.md`

2. **Generate Phase Evaluation:**
   - Create comprehensive phase evaluation in `ai-driven/evaluations/phase_evaluations.md`
   - Include: objectives met, quality score, rubric alignment, issues, improvements
   - **WAIT FOR HUMAN APPROVAL** before unlocking next phase

3. **If Approved:**
   - Update phase status in `Assignment_TODO_Tracker.md`
   - Update `ai-driven/state_tracker.json`
   - Log phase completion to `ai-driven/episodic_memory/`
   - Extract learnings and save to `ai-driven/learnings/`
   - Unlock next phase

4. **If Rejected:**
   - Capture detailed feedback
   - Create improvement plan
   - Update learning database
   - Address issues before proceeding

### 4. Progress Tracking Protocol

**Always Update These Files:**
- `ai-driven/state_tracker.json` - Real-time state (updated after every action)
- `Assignment_TODO_Tracker.md` - Task checkboxes and completion counts
- `ai-driven/episodic_memory/event_log.md` - Chronological event log
- `ai-driven/episodic_memory/task_history.md` - Task completion log

**IMPORTANT:** Only update existing files. Do NOT create new files outside `ai-driven/` unless explicitly requested.

**Progress Calculation:**
- Read `Assignment_TODO_Tracker.md` to count completed tasks
- Calculate percentages: (completed/total) × 100
- Update progress tables in tracker
- Update `ai-driven/state_tracker.json` progress metrics

3. **ALWAYS log to ai-driven/episodic_memory/** for significant events
4. **ALWAYS capture learnings** from feedback to `ai-driven/learnings/`
5. **ALWAYS check rubric alignment** before approval requests
6. **ALWAYS read assignment files** before starting work
7. **ALWAYS apply relevant learnings** from global database
8. **ALWAYS respond to "where are you"** with comprehensive status

## 📁 FILE CREATION RULES - CRITICAL

### STRICT FILE CREATION POLICY

**NEVER create files outside of `ai-driven/` folder unless:**
- Explicitly requested by user
- Creating assignment deliverables (in root or specified location)
- User explicitly asks for a file in a different location

**ALL intermediate files, logs, tracking, and system files MUST be in `ai-driven/`:**
- ✅ Use existing files in `ai-driven/` structure
- ✅ Update existing files, don't create new ones
- ✅ Log to existing episodic_memory files
- ✅ Use existing evaluation forms
- ✅ Use existing learning files
- ❌ DO NOT create new markdown files in root
- ❌ DO NOT create temporary files
- ❌ DO NOT create intermediate documentation
- ❌ DO NOT create new folders outside `ai-driven/`

### File Organization Rules

**When logging or tracking:**
- Use `ai-driven/episodic_memory/event_log.md` for events
- Use `ai-driven/episodic_memory/task_history.md` for task completions
- Use `ai-driven/episodic_memory/decision_log.md` for decisions
- Use `ai-driven/learnings/` files for learnings
- Use `ai-driven/evaluations/` files for evaluations
- Use `ai-driven/self_feedback/` files for self-assessments

**When creating context snapshots:**
- Save to `ai-driven/episodic_memory/context_snapshots/`
- Use naming: `snapshot_YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS.md`

**When user asks for documentation:**
- If it's system/tracking related → `ai-driven/`
- If it's assignment deliverable → root or specified location
- Always ask if unsure

### Consolidation Principle

**Before creating ANY new file, ask:**
1. Does an existing file in `ai-driven/` serve this purpose?
2. Can I append to an existing file instead?
3. Is this truly necessary or can I use existing structure?

**Prefer:**
- Appending to existing files
- Updating existing files
- Using existing structure
- Consolidating information

**Avoid:**
- Creating new files for one-off information
- Creating temporary files
- Creating files outside `ai-driven/`
- Duplicating information across files
