### Current Quality Standards:

#### Minimum Quality Threshold
- Work must meet all assignment requirements
- Professional formatting and presentation
- No obvious errors or typos
- Clear and well-organized

#### Quality Score Guidelines
- **5/5:** Exceeds expectations, professional, comprehensive
- **4/5:** Meets all requirements, high quality
- **3/5:** Meets requirements, acceptable quality
- **2/5:** Missing some requirements or quality issues
- **1/5:** Significant gaps or quality problems

### Quality Improvements Over Time:

**2025-11-29 - Pattern Analysis Update:**
Based on self-assessment weakness pattern analysis, quality standards updated to address recurring gaps.

## Quality Improvement History

### Improvement Entry: 2025-11-29

**Source:** Self-assessment weakness pattern analysis (TODO-001, TODO-002)

**Patterns Identified:**
1. **Quantitative Data Deficiency** (100% frequency)
   - Missing statistics, metrics, percentages
   - Impact: Reduces credibility, less convincing

2. **Visual Documentation Gaps** (50% frequency)
   - Missing diagrams, maps, visual aids
   - Impact: Less engaging, harder to understand

3. **Context/Specificity Gaps** (50% frequency)
   - Missing specific context, accessibility considerations
   - Impact: Less precise, potential misunderstandings

4. **Comparative Analysis Missing** (50% frequency)
   - Missing similar solutions, benchmarks
   - Impact: Less comprehensive, no validation

**Quality Standards Updated:**
- ✅ Added requirement for quantitative data when possible
- ✅ Added consideration for visual aids
- ✅ Enhanced specificity requirements
- ✅ Added comparative analysis consideration

**New Quality Checklist Items:**
- [ ] Quantitative data included (metrics, statistics)
- [ ] Visual aids considered (if needed)
- [ ] Specific context provided
- [ ] Comparative analysis included (if relevant)
- [ ] Accessibility/inclusivity considered

**Impact:**
- Future work will proactively address these gaps
- Quality standards raised from 4/5 baseline
- More comprehensive documentation expected
