# Workflow Creation Correction

## Issue Identified
Created Mermaid diagrams for workflow documentation instead of creating workflow in Agent Builder interface.

## Correct Approach
According to assignment requirements:
- Workflows should be created IN Agent Builder interface
- Screenshots should show workflow in Agent Builder
- Not separate Mermaid diagram files

## Action Required
1. Create workflow in Agent Builder interface
2. Capture screenshots of workflow in Agent Builder
3. Update documentation to reflect Agent Builder workflow creation
4. Remove or clarify that Mermaid diagrams are supplementary documentation, not the primary workflow

## Assignment Requirement
Deliverable 2: "Documented Workflows and Integration Points"
- Workflows should be created in Agent Builder
- Screenshots should show Agent Builder workflow setup
- Diagrams should show triggers, actions, data flow from Agent Builder interface

## Status
- ❌ Created Mermaid diagrams (incorrect approach)
- ✅ Need to create workflow in Agent Builder
- ✅ Need to capture screenshots of Agent Builder workflow
