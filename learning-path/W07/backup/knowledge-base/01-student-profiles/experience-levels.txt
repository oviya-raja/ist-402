Open Source:
- Substantial contributions: Count as 0.25-0.5 years
- Maintainer role: Count as 0.5-1 year

EXAMPLES
========

Example 1: New Grad
-------------------
- 2 summer internships (3 months each) = 0.5 years
- 1 significant academic project = 0.25 years
- Total: 0.75 years ≈ Entry-level

Example 2: Recent Grad with Experience
---------------------------------------
- 1 year full-time work = 1 year
- 1 summer internship = 0.25 years
- Total: 1.25 years ≈ Entry to Mid-level

Example 3: Career Transition
-----------------------------
- 3 years in different field = 0 years (not relevant)
- 1 year in tech role = 1 year
- Total: 1 year ≈ Entry-level in tech

MATCHING EXPERIENCE TO JOB REQUIREMENTS
=======================================

Job Requires "0-2 years":
- 0-2 years experience = 100% match
- 2-3 years experience = 100% match (still qualifies)
- 3+ years experience = 100% match (overqualified but still qualifies)

Job Requires "2-5 years":
- 0-2 years experience = 40-80% match (depends on exact years)
- 2-5 years experience = 100% match
- 5+ years experience = 100% match (overqualified)

Job Requires "5+ years":
- 0-2 years experience = 0-40% match (likely won't qualify)
- 2-5 years experience = 40-100% match (depends on exact years)
- 5+ years experience = 100% match
