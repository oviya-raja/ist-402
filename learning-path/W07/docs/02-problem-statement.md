# Problem Statement

## The Problem

Final year students struggle to efficiently identify job opportunities matching their profile. Manual job search is time-consuming, requiring constant monitoring of multiple company job boards and subjective fitment assessment.

## Key Challenges

- **Time-consuming manual search:** Hours spent checking multiple company websites daily
- **Difficulty assessing fitment:** Subjective and inconsistent evaluation of job fitment
- **Skill gap identification:** Hard to identify specific areas to improve for target roles

## The Solution

An AI agent that automatically:
- Searches company job sites for matching positions
- Analyzes job postings against student profiles
- Provides fitment percentages with skill gap identification
- Delivers objective, consistent assessments

## Target Companies

Target companies are configurable via CSV file (`target-companies.csv`). Default companies include:

- Cisco
- SAP
- Google
- Apple
- Amazon
- Tesla

**Configuration:** Companies can be added, removed, or prioritized by editing the CSV file. See [target-companies.csv](target-companies.csv) for the current configuration.
