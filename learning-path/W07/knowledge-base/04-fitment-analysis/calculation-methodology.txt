FITMENT CALCULATION METHODOLOGY
Job Fitment Analysis Agent - Knowledge Base

This document explains how to calculate job fitment percentages for students.

FITMENT CALCULATION OVERVIEW
============================

Fitment percentage represents how well a student's profile matches a job's requirements.
Range: 0-100%
Higher percentage = better match

CALCULATION COMPONENTS
======================

1. REQUIRED SKILLS MATCH (Weight: 40%)
--------------------------------------
Most Critical Component

Calculation:
- Count required skills from job posting
- Count how many student has
- Match percentage = (student's required skills / total required skills) × 100

Example:
Job requires: Python, Java, AWS, SQL (4 required skills)
Student has: Python, Java, AWS (3 skills)
Match: 3/4 = 75%

Weighted Score: 75% × 40% = 30 points

2. PREFERRED SKILLS MATCH (Weight: 20%)
----------------------------------------
Bonus Points Component

Calculation:
- Count preferred skills from job posting
- Count how many student has
- Match percentage = (student's preferred skills / total preferred skills) × 100

Example:
Job prefers: Kubernetes, Docker, React (3 preferred skills)
Student has: Docker, React (2 skills)
Match: 2/3 = 67%

Weighted Score: 67% × 20% = 13.4 points

3. EXPERIENCE MATCH (Weight: 25%)
----------------------------------
Years of Experience Alignment

Calculation:
- Job requires: X years
- Student has: Y years
- If Y >= X: 100% match
- If Y < X: (Y / X) × 100% (capped at 100%)

Example 1:
Job requires: 2+ years
Student has: 3 years
Match: 100% (exceeds requirement)

Example 2:
Job requires: 3+ years
Student has: 1 year
Match: 1/3 = 33%

Weighted Score: 33% × 25% = 8.25 points

Special Cases:
- Entry-level/New grad: 0-1 years = 100% match
- Internship: Currently enrolled = 100% match

4. EDUCATION MATCH (Weight: 10%)
----------------------------------
Degree Level Alignment

Calculation:
- Job requires: BS/MS/PhD
- Student has: BS/MS/PhD
- Exact match: 100%
- Higher degree: 100% (BS required, student has MS = 100%)
- Lower degree: 50% (MS required, student has BS = 50%)
- Related field: 75% (CS required, student has EE = 75%)

Example:
Job requires: BS in Computer Science
Student has: BS in Computer Science
Match: 100%

Weighted Score: 100% × 10% = 10 points

5. LOCATION MATCH (Weight: 5%)
-------------------------------
Work Arrangement Alignment

Calculation:
- Job offers: Remote/Hybrid/On-site
- Student prefers: Remote/Hybrid/On-site
- Exact match: 100%
- Flexible student: 100% (student flexible = always match)
- Mismatch: 0% (job on-site, student wants remote = 0%)

Example:
Job offers: Remote or San Francisco, CA
Student prefers: Remote or San Francisco, CA
Match: 100%

Weighted Score: 100% × 5% = 5 points

PRIORITY-BASED WEIGHTING
=========================

Priority 1 Companies (High Focus):
- More detailed analysis
- All components calculated
- Detailed breakdown provided

Priority 2 Companies (Moderate Focus):
- Standard analysis
- All components calculated
- Summary breakdown

Priority 3 Companies (Lower Focus):
- Basic analysis
- Key components only
- High-level fitment

FINAL FITMENT CALCULATION
==========================

Formula:
Total Fitment = (Required Skills × 40%) + (Preferred Skills × 20%) + 
                 (Experience × 25%) + (Education × 10%) + (Location × 5%)

Example Calculation:
====================

Job Requirements:
- Required Skills: Python, Java, AWS, SQL (4 skills)
- Preferred Skills: Kubernetes, Docker (2 skills)
- Experience: 2+ years
- Education: BS in CS
- Location: Remote or SF

Student Profile:
- Skills: Python, Java, AWS, Docker (3 required, 1 preferred)
- Experience: 1.5 years
- Education: BS in CS
- Location: Remote or SF

Calculation:
1. Required Skills: 3/4 = 75% × 40% = 30 points
2. Preferred Skills: 1/2 = 50% × 20% = 10 points
3. Experience: 1.5/2 = 75% × 25% = 18.75 points
4. Education: 100% × 10% = 10 points
5. Location: 100% × 5% = 5 points

Total Fitment: 30 + 10 + 18.75 + 10 + 5 = 73.75% ≈ 74%

FITMENT INTERPRETATION
======================

90-100%: EXCELLENT MATCH
-------------------------
- Student meets or exceeds all requirements
- Strong candidate
- High confidence recommendation
- Minor gaps only

75-89%: GOOD MATCH
------------------
- Student meets most requirements
- Competitive candidate
- Some skill gaps but manageable
- Worth applying

60-74%: MODERATE MATCH
----------------------
- Student meets core requirements
- Some significant gaps
- May need skill development
- Consider if interested, but prioritize better matches

45-59%: WEAK MATCH
------------------
- Significant skill gaps
- Missing key requirements
- Would need substantial learning
- Not recommended unless very interested

Below 45%: POOR MATCH
---------------------
- Major gaps in requirements
- Missing critical skills
- Not a good fit
- Recommend alternative roles

ADJUSTMENTS & CONSIDERATIONS
=============================

Skill Proficiency Levels:
- If job requires "Advanced" but student has "Intermediate": 75% match for that skill
- If job requires "Intermediate" but student has "Advanced": 100% match (exceeds)

Project Experience:
- Personal projects can count as experience
- Academic projects can supplement
- Internships count as professional experience

Transferable Skills:
- Related skills can partially count
- Example: Java experience can partially count for C# requirement (50%)

Soft Skills:
- Considered but not heavily weighted
- Important for overall assessment
- Can boost fitment by 2-5% if strong

SPECIAL CASES
=============

New Grad Programs:
- Designed for entry-level
- 0-1 years experience = 100% experience match
- Focus on fundamentals and potential

Internships:
- Currently enrolled student = 100% education match
- No experience required = 100% experience match
- Focus on learning ability

Career Changers:
- Transferable skills important
- Related experience can count
- Willingness to learn emphasized
