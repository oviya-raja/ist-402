SKILL GAP IDENTIFICATION FRAMEWORK
Job Fitment Analysis Agent - Knowledge Base

This document explains how to identify and categorize skill gaps between student profiles and job requirements.

SKILL GAP CATEGORIES
====================

1. CRITICAL GAPS (Must-Have Skills Missing)
--------------------------------------------
Definition: Required skills that student doesn't have

Impact: High - Prevents qualification
Priority: Highest - Must address to be competitive

Identification:
- Compare job's REQUIRED skills vs. student's skills
- List all required skills student is missing
- Note proficiency level required

Example:
Job requires: Python (Advanced), Java (Intermediate), AWS (Intermediate)
Student has: Python (Advanced), Java (Beginner)
Gap: Java needs improvement from Beginner to Intermediate (CRITICAL)

2. IMPORTANT GAPS (Preferred Skills Missing)
---------------------------------------------
Definition: Preferred skills that student doesn't have

Impact: Medium - Reduces competitiveness
Priority: High - Should address for better fitment

Identification:
- Compare job's PREFERRED skills vs. student's skills
- List all preferred skills student is missing
- These are bonus points

Example:
Job prefers: Kubernetes, Docker, React
Student has: Docker
Gap: Kubernetes (missing), React (missing) - IMPORTANT gaps

3. SKILL LEVEL GAPS (Have Skill, Need Improvement)
---------------------------------------------------
Definition: Student has skill but at lower proficiency than required

Impact: Medium-High - Affects performance expectations
Priority: High - Needs improvement to meet requirements

Identification:
- Student has skill but at lower level
- Job requires higher proficiency
- Need to improve from current level to required level

Example:
Job requires: Python (Advanced)
Student has: Python (Intermediate)
Gap: Python proficiency needs improvement from Intermediate to Advanced

GAP PRIORITIZATION METHODOLOGY
===============================

Priority 1: Critical Missing Skills
------------------------------------
- Required skills student doesn't have at all
- Must learn to be qualified
- Highest priority for learning

Priority 2: Skill Level Improvements
-------------------------------------
- Skills student has but needs to improve
- Required proficiency higher than current
- Important for meeting requirements

Priority 3: Preferred Skills
------------------------------
- Nice-to-have skills student doesn't have
- Increases competitiveness
- Lower priority but valuable

Priority 4: Nice-to-Have Skills
-------------------------------
- Bonus skills that would help
- Not required or preferred
- Lowest priority

GAP ANALYSIS PROCESS
====================

Step 1: Extract Job Requirements
---------------------------------
- List all required skills with proficiency levels
- List all preferred skills with proficiency levels
- Note any skill combinations or patterns

Step 2: Compare with Student Profile
-------------------------------------
- Match student's skills against requirements
- Identify missing required skills
- Identify missing preferred skills
- Identify skills at lower proficiency

Step 3: Categorize Gaps
-----------------------
- Critical: Missing required skills
- Important: Missing preferred skills
- Level Gap: Skill exists but needs improvement

Step 4: Prioritize Gaps
-----------------------
- Rank by importance (Critical > Important > Level Gap > Nice-to-Have)
- Consider frequency across multiple target roles
- Consider learning difficulty/time

Step 5: Generate Recommendations
----------------------------------
- Specific skills to learn
- Proficiency level to achieve
- Learning resources
- Estimated time to learn

EXAMPLE GAP ANALYSIS
====================

Job: Software Engineer I - Backend
Company: Tech Company

Job Requirements:
REQUIRED:
- Python (Advanced)
- REST API development (Intermediate)
- PostgreSQL (Intermediate)
- 2+ years experience

PREFERRED:
- AWS (Intermediate)
- Docker (Intermediate)
- Microservices (Beginner)

Student Profile:
Skills:
- Python (Intermediate)
- Java (Advanced)
- REST API development (Beginner)
- MySQL (Intermediate)
- Docker (Beginner)
- 1.5 years experience

GAP ANALYSIS:

CRITICAL GAPS:
1. Python proficiency: Intermediate → Advanced (Level Gap)
2. REST API development: Beginner → Intermediate (Level Gap)
3. PostgreSQL: Missing (Critical - need to learn)
4. Experience: 1.5 years vs. 2+ years (0.5 years short)

IMPORTANT GAPS:
1. AWS: Missing (Preferred skill)
2. Docker: Beginner → Intermediate (Level Gap)
3. Microservices: Missing (Preferred skill)

PRIORITIZED LEARNING PLAN:
1. Learn PostgreSQL (Critical, 2-3 weeks)
2. Improve Python to Advanced (Critical, 1-2 months)
3. Improve REST API development (Critical, 1 month)
4. Learn AWS basics (Important, 1-2 months)
5. Improve Docker skills (Important, 2-3 weeks)
6. Learn Microservices basics (Important, 1 month)

FREQUENCY-BASED PRIORITIZATION
===============================

When analyzing multiple target roles, prioritize gaps that appear frequently:

Example:
Student targeting: Google, Amazon, Microsoft

Common Required Skills Across All:
- Python: Required by all 3 (HIGH PRIORITY)
- System Design: Required by all 3 (HIGH PRIORITY)
- Algorithms: Required by all 3 (HIGH PRIORITY)

Company-Specific:
- Kubernetes: Only Google (LOWER PRIORITY)
- .NET: Only Microsoft (LOWER PRIORITY)

Strategy: Focus on high-frequency gaps first for maximum impact.

GAP IMPACT ASSESSMENT
=====================

For each gap, assess:

1. Impact on Fitment
---------------------
- Critical gap: -15 to -25% fitment
- Important gap: -5 to -10% fitment
- Level gap: -5 to -15% fitment (depending on size)

2. Learning Difficulty
----------------------
- Easy: 1-2 weeks (new tool, basic concepts)
- Medium: 1-2 months (new language, framework)
- Hard: 2-6 months (complex systems, deep expertise)

3. Time to Learn
----------------
- Quick wins: 1-2 weeks
- Medium-term: 1-2 months
- Long-term: 3-6 months

4. Career Value
---------------
- High: Used across many roles
- Medium: Used in specific roles
- Low: Niche skill

RECOMMENDATION GENERATION
==========================

For each gap, provide:

1. Skill Name
2. Current Status: Missing or Current Level
3. Target Level: Required Level
4. Learning Resources: Courses, tutorials, projects
5. Estimated Time: Weeks/months
6. Impact: How much this will improve fitment
7. Priority: Critical/Important/Level Gap/Nice-to-Have

Example Recommendation:
-----------------------
Skill: PostgreSQL
Current: Missing
Target: Intermediate
Learning Resources:
- PostgreSQL Tutorial (official docs)
- "PostgreSQL for Beginners" course (Coursera)
- Build a project using PostgreSQL
Estimated Time: 2-3 weeks
Impact: +8-10% fitment (critical skill)
Priority: CRITICAL
