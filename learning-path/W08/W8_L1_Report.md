## 2. Methods

### 2.1 PDF Q&A Implementation Methodology

#### 2.1.1 Architecture Overview

The PDF Q&A system implements a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** architecture, combining semantic search with language model generation to provide accurate, contextually grounded answers.

```
User Query → Embedding → Vector Search (FAISS) → Top-K Chunks → 
Context Augmentation → FLAN-T5 Generation → Answer
```

#### 2.1.2 Document Processing Pipeline

**1. PDF Parsing:**
- **Tool:** `pypdf` library for PDF text extraction
- **Process:** 
  - Read uploaded PDF files as binary streams
  - Extract text from each page using `PdfReader`
  - Handle errors gracefully for corrupted or unreadable pages
  - Combine all pages into a single text document

**2. Text Chunking:**
- **Tool:** LangChain's `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`

  - Larger chunks help maintain semantic coherence for complex questions
  - Recursive splitting respects sentence and paragraph boundaries when possible

**3. Embedding Generation:**
- **Model:** `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2`
- **Specifications:**
  - Dimensions: 384
  - Architecture: DistilBERT-based
  - Training: 1B+ sentence pairs
- **Rationale:**

  - Good balance between quality and computational efficiency
  - Widely used in production RAG systems
  - Compatible with FAISS for efficient similarity search

**4. Vector Store Construction:**
- **Tool:** FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search)
- **Process:**
  - Convert document chunks to embeddings using the MiniLM model
  - Build an in-memory FAISS index
  - Store embeddings with metadata (chunk content, source document)
- **Advantages:**
  - Fast similarity search (sub-millisecond for small to medium datasets)
  - Memory efficient
  - Supports both CPU and GPU acceleration
  - No external database required for this use case

**5. Query Processing:**
- **Retrieval:**

  - Return chunks ranked by cosine similarity

**6. Answer Generation:**
- **Model:** `google/flan-t5-large` (with fallback to `google/flan-t5-base`)
- **Specifications:**
  - Architecture: T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer)
  - Parameters: 780M (large variant) / 250M (base variant as fallback)
  - Task: Sequence-to-sequence generation
  - Model Selection: System attempts to load flan-t5-large first for better answer quality, falls back to base variant if memory constraints prevent loading the larger model
- **Prompt Engineering:**
  - Context-aware prompt structure:
    ```
    You are a helpful assistant. Answer the question using ONLY the context.
    If the answer is not in the context, say you don't know.
    
    Context:
    [Chunk 1]
    [Chunk 2]
    ...
    
    Question: {user_query}
    Answer:
    ```
  - Instructions emphasize grounding answers in provided context
  - Explicit instruction to admit uncertainty when context is insufficient
- **Generation Parameters:**
  - Max new tokens: 256 (adjustable 64-512)
  - Temperature: 0.2 (low for factual accuracy)

## 4. Learning & Future Work

### 4.1 Key Learnings

#### 4.1.1 RAG Systems and Retrieval-Augmented Generation

**What We Learned:**
- **RAG Architecture:** Understanding the complete RAG pipeline from document ingestion to answer generation was invaluable. We learned that retrieval quality is the foundation - poor retrieval leads to poor answers regardless of the LLM quality.

- **Chunking Strategy:** The importance of chunk size and overlap became clear. Too small chunks lose context, too large chunks dilute relevance. The 1000-character chunk with 200-character overlap provided a good balance, offering better context preservation while maintaining retrieval relevance.

- **Embedding Models:** We discovered that embedding model choice significantly impacts retrieval quality. MiniLM-L6-v2, while efficient, may not capture all semantic nuances. Larger models like `text-embedding-3-large` could improve results but at computational cost.

- **Vector Search:** FAISS demonstrated impressive speed for similarity search. The in-memory approach works well for moderate-sized document collections, but larger systems would benefit from persistent vector databases (Pinecone, Weaviate, Chroma).

- **Prompt Engineering:** The structure of the prompt to FLAN-T5 significantly affects answer quality. Explicit instructions to use only context and admit uncertainty when information is missing are crucial for reducing hallucinations. The system uses an instruction-following format optimized for FLAN-T5's training, which improves answer quality and reduces hallucination.

**Course Connections:**
- **Week 2 (RAG Foundations):** This project directly applied RAG concepts learned in class, including retrieval strategies and context augmentation.
- **Week 3 (RAG Production):** We implemented production considerations like error handling, user interface, and performance optimization.
- **Embeddings (Week 2):** Applied embedding concepts to convert documents and queries to vector representations for semantic search.

#### 4.1.2 Multimodal AI and Cross-Modal Understanding

**What We Learned:**
- **Speech-to-Text:** Whisper's accuracy was impressive, even with the tiny variant. We learned that clear audio input is crucial, and the model handles various accents and speaking styles well.

- **Text-to-Image Generation:** Stable Diffusion's ability to interpret text prompts and generate relevant images demonstrated the power of diffusion models. We learned that prompt engineering matters - more descriptive prompts generally yield better results.

- **Pipeline Integration:** Connecting multiple AI models (Whisper → Stable Diffusion) required careful handling of data formats, error propagation, and user feedback. We learned the importance of clear intermediate outputs (showing transcription before generation).

- **Multimodal Challenges:** Each modality (audio, text, image) has different characteristics and requirements. Successfully integrating them requires understanding each component's strengths and limitations.

**Course Connections:**
- **Transformer Architectures:** Both Whisper and Stable Diffusion use transformer-based architectures, connecting to course content on attention mechanisms and sequence-to-sequence models.
- **Multimodal Learning:** This project demonstrated practical applications of multimodal AI, connecting different data types (speech, text, images).

#### 4.1.3 Vision-Language Models

**What We Learned:**
- **BLIP Architecture:** Understanding how BLIP combines vision and language encoders provided insight into vision-language model design. The model's ability to generate coherent captions from visual input demonstrated the power of joint vision-language training.

- **Image Understanding:** We learned that caption quality depends on image complexity, clarity, and the presence of recognizable objects. The model excels at common objects and scenes but struggles with abstract or highly artistic content.

- **Model Limitations:** BLIP base model, while efficient, sometimes produces generic captions. Larger variants or fine-tuned models could improve specificity and detail.

**Course Connections:**
- **Computer Vision:** This project connected to course content on image processing and understanding.
- **Language Models:** BLIP's language decoder connects to course content on text generation and language modeling.

#### 4.1.4 Practical Implementation Insights

**What We Learned:**
- **Model Selection Trade-offs:** Choosing between model variants involves balancing accuracy, speed, and resource requirements. For this project, we prioritized functionality and reasonable performance over state-of-the-art accuracy.

- **User Interface Design:** Streamlit provided an excellent rapid prototyping platform. We learned the importance of clear feedback, progress indicators, and error messages in AI applications.

- **Deployment Considerations:** Running models in Colab with ngrok tunneling demonstrated practical deployment challenges. Production systems would require more robust infrastructure (GPU servers, proper authentication, scaling).

- **Error Handling:** Robust error handling is crucial when working with user inputs (PDFs, audio files, images). We learned to validate inputs, handle edge cases, and provide informative error messages.

### 4.2 Challenges Encountered and Solutions

#### 4.2.1 Challenge: Memory Limitations with Large PDFs

**Problem:** Processing very large PDFs (>100 pages) caused memory issues, especially when building the FAISS index.

**Solution:** 
- Implemented chunking strategy to process documents in manageable pieces
- Used efficient embedding model (MiniLM) to reduce memory footprint

- Optimized inference steps (default 25 provides good quality/speed balance)
- Enabled attention slicing to reduce memory usage
- Documented that GPU would be significantly faster

**Learning:** User expectations and feedback are important. Clear communication about processing times improves user experience even when technical limitations exist.

#### 4.2.3 Challenge: Generic Captions from BLIP

**Problem:** BLIP sometimes generates generic captions that lack specificity (e.g., "a person in a room" instead of more detailed descriptions).

**Solution:**
- This is a model limitation rather than an implementation issue
- Tested with diverse images to understand model capabilities
- Documented limitations in results section
- Considered using larger BLIP variants or fine-tuning (future work)

**Learning:** Understanding model limitations is important for setting realistic expectations and planning improvements.

#### 4.2.4 Challenge: Integration Complexity

**Problem:** Integrating multiple models (Whisper, Stable Diffusion) with Streamlit and ngrok required careful coordination of dependencies, model loading, and error handling.

**Solution:**
- Used Streamlit's caching (`@st.cache_resource`) to load models once
- Implemented clear error messages for each stage
- Created modular code structure separating concerns (transcription, generation, UI)
- Tested each component independently before integration

**Learning:** Modular design and clear separation of concerns make complex systems more maintainable and debuggable.
