        "\n",
        "## Overview\n",
        "This notebook implements an image captioning system using the BLIP (Bootstrapping Language-Image Pre-training) model to generate accurate, descriptive captions for uploaded images.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Architecture\n",
        "BLIP uses a vision-language transformer architecture:\n",
        "- **Vision Encoder**: Processes image into visual features\n",
        "- **Multimodal Fusion**: Combines visual and textual representations  \n",
        "- **Language Decoder**: Generates caption text autoregressively\n",
        "\n",
        "## Features\n",
        "- **Automatic Captioning**: Generate descriptive captions for any image\n",
        "- **Multiple Format Support**: JPG, JPEG, PNG\n",
        "- **Fast Processing**: ~2-5 seconds per image\n",
        "- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple upload and view workflow\n",
        "- **Robust Handling**: Works with various image sizes and aspect ratios\n",
        "\n",
        "## Usage\n",
        "1. Run the cell below to install dependencies and launch the app\n",
        "2. Upload an image using the file uploader\n",
        "3. View the automatically generated caption\n",
        "4. Upload additional images to test with different types\n",
        "\n",
        "## Technical Stack\n",
        "- **Model**: Salesforce BLIP (blip-image-captioning-base)\n",
        "- **Image Processing**: PIL (Pillow)\n",
        "- **UI Framework**: Streamlit\n",
        "- **Deep Learning**: Transformers (Hugging Face)"

        "3. Displays the result\n",

        "### Testing with Different Image Types\n",
        "\n",
        "**Nature/Landscape Images:**\n",
        "- Mountain scenes, beaches, forests\n",
        "- Expected: Captions describing scenery, natural elements\n",
        "\n",
        "**People/Portrait Images:**\n",
        "- Portraits, group photos, candid shots\n",
        "- Expected: Captions identifying people and activities\n",

        "- Street scenes, indoor settings, activities\n",
        "- Expected: Captions describing setting and context\n",
        "\n",
        "### Understanding the Output\n",
        "- **Accuracy**: BLIP excels at identifying common objects and scenes\n",
        "- **Detail Level**: Captions are generally accurate but may be somewhat generic\n",
        "- **Limitations**: May miss fine details or abstract/artistic elements\n",
        "\n",
        "### Testing Limitations\n",
        "\n",
        "To demonstrate BLIP's limitations (missing fine details or abstract elements), try these images from `data/`:\n",
        "\n",
        "**Best images to show limitations:**\n",
        "1. **`scene_street.jpg`** - Complex scenes with many details\n",
        "   - Look for: Missing specific objects, people, or activities in the background\n",
        "   - BLIP may give a generic \"street scene\" description rather than detailed elements\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **`scene_activity.jpg`** - Activity scenes with multiple elements\n",
        "   - Look for: Generic activity description vs. specific actions or interactions\n",
        "   - May miss subtle interactions or specific activities happening\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **`people_group.jpg`** - Group photos with multiple people\n",
        "   - Look for: Generic \"group of people\" vs. specific number, poses, or interactions\n",
        "   - May miss individual details or relationships between people\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **`object_everyday.jpg`** - Everyday objects with fine details\n",
        "   - Look for: Generic object identification vs. specific brand, model, or detailed features\n",
        "   - May miss subtle design elements or specific characteristics\n",
        "\n",
        "**How to test:**\n",
        "1. Upload one of these images in the Streamlit app\n",
        "2. Compare the generated caption with what you actually see\n",
        "3. Note what specific details, objects, or elements are missing\n",
        "4. The caption will likely be accurate but generic, missing fine-grained details\n",
        "\n",
        "### Tips\n",
        "- Use clear, well-lit images for best results\n",
        "- The model works with various image sizes (auto-resized internally)\n",
        "- Processing time: ~2-5 seconds per image\n",
        "- For limitation testing: Choose complex scenes or images with many fine details"
