Product,Review
Queen Size Sheet Set,"I ordered a king size set. My only criticism would be that I wish they would offer the set in other colors. The set I received was white and I would have preferred a different color option."
Waterproof Phone Pouch,"I loved the waterproof sac, although the opening was a bit small for my phone. It worked well for keeping my phone dry during water activities."
Luxury Air Mattress,"This mattress had a small hole in the top of it. I was disappointed with the quality."
Pillows Insert,"This is the best throw pillow fillers on Amazon. They are soft, fluffy, and hold their shape well."
Milk Frother Handheld,"I loved this product. But they only seem to last about 6 months before breaking."
