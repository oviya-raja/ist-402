# Global Learnings - Shared Across All Assignments

This directory contains learnings that apply to **all assignments**, not just one specific assignment.

## Purpose

Learnings extracted from individual assignments are analyzed, and universal patterns are saved here. These learnings are automatically applied to future assignments.

## Files

- `quality_standards.md` - Universal quality standards
- `common_errors.md` - Common mistakes across assignments
- `best_practices.md` - Best practices that work well
- `success_patterns.md` - Successful approaches to replicate
- `process_improvements.md` - Process improvements identified

## How It Works

1. **During Assignment:** Learnings captured in assignment-specific `learnings/` folder
2. **After Assignment:** Universal patterns extracted and saved here
3. **Before New Assignment:** System loads learnings from here and applies them

## Usage

The `.cursorrules` file automatically loads learnings from this directory when starting work on any assignment. No manual intervention needed.
