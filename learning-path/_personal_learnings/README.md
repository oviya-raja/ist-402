## 🎯 Purpose

- **Separate from assignments**: These notes won't interfere with class work
- **Personal reference**: Your own learning journey and insights
- **Experiments**: Try new ideas without affecting class structure
- **Knowledge base**: Build your own understanding of concepts

## 📝 What Goes Here

✅ **Personal notes** about concepts you're learning  
✅ **Experiments** and code you write for your own learning  
✅ **Bloom's Taxonomy** implementations and examples  
✅ **LLM fundamentals** notes (tokens, embeddings, transformers)  
✅ **Personal projects** that aren't class assignments  

❌ **NOT class assignments** (those go in `W##/02-assignments/`)  
❌ **NOT class exercises** (those go in `W##/01-exercises/`)  

## 🔗 Integration with Knowledge Base

You can reference these personal learnings in:
- Your orchestrator queries
- RAG systems
- Personal study sessions
