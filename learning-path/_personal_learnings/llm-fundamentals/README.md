# LLM Fundamentals - Personal Notes

Core AI concepts and how LLMs work.

## 🧠 Core Concepts

### 1. Tokens
Text split into small units (tokens).

### 2. Embeddings
Tokens → vectors (numerical representation).

### 3. Vector Relationships (Attention)
The model computes how each token/vector relates to every other.

### 4. Layers
Stacked attention + feedforward blocks that apply transformations repeatedly.

### 5. Tensors
Data and weights stored in multi-dimensional arrays.

### 6. Parameters (Weights)
Learned numerical values inside tensors, updated during training.

## 🔗 Flow

**LLM = Tokens → Embeddings → Vector Relationships (Attention) → Layers → Tensors → Parameters (Weights)**
